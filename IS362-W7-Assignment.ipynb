    "The benefit of using Normalization is that tries to account for the variation in the way people rate things. In our program, for example, Dan appears to rate movies higher than Madison generally does. It could be true that they both like the movies that the like to the same degree, but their method of rating is different. Normazliation helps to account for these types of differences in the data. However, a disadvantage that may arise is that the normalization used may not be suitable for all types of data. "
